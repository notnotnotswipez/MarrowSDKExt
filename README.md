# Extended Flask Marrow SDK thingamabob
The doohickey
Combines maranarasauce/MarrowSDK for Flask support, and Kairus101/MarrowSDKExt for extended SDK support
Literally just merged these two repos and that's it


# Marrow SDK (With extra data classes)
Extended SDK Tools used to make Mods for the Marrow Interaction Engine, packaged content in Crates stacked on Pallets.  
# [Documentation](https://github.com/StressLevelZero/MarrowSDK/wiki)


# Forked and extended to include data classes in the SDK assemblies
